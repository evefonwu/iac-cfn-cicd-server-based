### IaC CloudFormation CI/CD Server-based architecture Demo

This is a demo of Infrastructure-as-Code with AWS CloudFormation for a server-based architecture, part of my first series of projects where I tried out as many AWS services as I could and optimized for learning and getting more experienced. This is blog post: [Preparing for a Cloud Engineering Role](https://dev.to/evefonwu/preparing-for-a-cloud-engineering-role-bof)

Creates a CI/CD pipeline to develop an Express server application deployed into a server-based architecture (EC2s, ASG + ALB) in a non-default VPC with private subnets for the EC2s.

Application server at: `http://<ALB-DNS-NAME>:8080`

### TODO:

Update the documentation for this project.
